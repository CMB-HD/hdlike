# whether to use delensed data 
delensed: True

# whether to include baryonic feedback in the data
# NOTE that if `baryonic_feedback` is `True`, you should set the CAMB 
# `halofit_version` to be `'mead2020_feedback'` in your Cobaya YAML file.
baryonic_feedback: False

# set `use_cmb_power_spectra: True` to use the TT, TE, EE, BB lensed or delensed CMB power spectra
use_cmb_power_spectra: True
# set `use_cmb_lensing_spectrum: True` to use the lensing convergence power spectrum, C_L^kk = [L(L+1)]^2 C_L^phiphi / 4
use_cmb_lensing_spectrum: True

# set the maximum multipole of the data to be used:
# `lmax` determines highest bin edge for the CMB data, is used to trim the 
#   data/covmat (if it goes higher), and is used in theory calculation.
# `Lmax` serves the same purpose as `lmax`, but for the lensing spectrum.
lmax: 20100
Lmax: 20100

# set the version of the CMB-HD data to use:
# by default, the latest CMB-HD data is used. it is loaded using `hdMockData`.
# if you would like to reproduce a specific set of results, you can use the
#  corresponding `hd_data_version`. see the readme in the `hdMockData` repository
#  for more information about each version: github.com/CMB-HD/hdMockData
hd_data_version: latest

# --- data files: leave blank to use HD data ---
# NOTE that, if you provide alternative filenames for, e.g., the binned data spectra,
#      the likelihood does not check if the data is compatible (for example, the same
#      number of bins in the data and covariance matrix, or if that matches the given
#      multipole range and bin edges) 
# See the `readme` in the `data` directory for details about the formatting of the files.

# data file should contain a single column of binned power spectra, e.g.,
# [cltt, clte, clee, clbb, clkk] (first four if `has_cmb_power_spectra = True`, last if 
# `has_cmb_lensing_spectrum = True`; see below)
data_file: 
# covmat for data should have different blocks corresponding to the spectra
# in the data vector, e.g., cltt x cltt, cltt x clte, etc., and should be
# binned using the same same binning
covmat_file: 
# the bin edges used to bin data and covmat
bin_file: 
# the unbinned lensing reconstruction noise; file has two columns: L, N_L
# where N_L is the noise on the lensing spectrum clkk
recon_noise_file: 

# If you're providing custom files above (e.g., to test a new model), you can change
#  the minimum multipole `lmin` of your data below, which sets the lowest bin edge for 
#  BOTH the CMB and CMB lensing data.
# NOTE that the likelihood assumes all data begins at `lmin` (but it can go
#      beyond `lmax`). to use a different `lmin`, you will need to trim the 
#      binned data and provide the new file names.
lmin: 30

# tell likelihood what the data files contain (even if we do not want to use all of it):
# set `has_cmb_power_spectra: True` if the data contains TT, TE, EE, BB lensed or delensed CMB power spectra
# set `has_cmb_lensing_spectrum: True` if the data contains the lensing convergence power spectrum, C_L^kk = [L(L+1)]^2 C_L^phiphi / 4

has_cmb_lensing_spectrum: True
